# Final Project - AAI 500 (Team 4)

## Team Members
- Tavia Wooten: Data Cleaning/Preparation
- Francisco Monarrez Felix: EDA & Visualization
- Noslinn Gisselle Tosta: Modeling & Metrics

## Project Description
This project performs an end-to-end statistical analysis of the **UCI Student Performance dataset** ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance)) using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  

Our objectives are to:
- Identify demographic, social, and academic factors most strongly associated with final course performance (G3).  
- Develop baseline models to estimate grades or pass/fail outcomes.  
- Provide visualizations and insights that explain patterns in the dataset.  

## Repository Structure
- `project_notebook.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with analysis  
- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets (`student-mat.csv`, `student-por.csv`, `student_clean.csv`)  
- `figures/`: Plots and visualizations  
- `report.md`: Draft project report (Introduction, Cleaning, EDA, Modeling, Conclusion)  
- `README.md`: Project overview  

## Instructions
1. Clone repo: `git clone <repo-link>`  
2. Open `project_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
3. Each member works on their assigned section (Cleaning, EDA, Modeling).  
4. Push changes to GitHub with clear commit messages.  
5. Check `report.md` for the evolving written report.
